      <h2>From Christmas Windows to Business Analysis: A Personal Journey in Design and Collaboration</h2>
      <p class=""date"> June 2025</p>
      <p>When I was growing up, my family had a large picture window at the front of our house — the perfect canvas for our annual Christmas display. Each year, my siblings and I would take turns choosing the theme for that window. It felt like play, but looking back, it was an early introduction to many of the skills I now use every day as a business analyst. We had to think about storytelling, composition, materials, budget, and timelines. We had to clearly communicate our vision and get buy-in from the rest of the family — much like working with a project team. There were negotiations, trade-offs, creative problem-solving, and always a sense of delivering something that others would enjoy. That spirit has stayed with me. These days, I build Lemax village displays during the holidays. It might sound whimsical, but it's surprisingly similar to BA work. I have constraints: space, time, even the number of power outlets I can use. I work with different "clients" (sometimes setting up displays in other people’s homes), and my goal is always to make the process smooth and enjoyable for them. I tailor the design based on what’s important to them — whether the village will be viewed at night (where light and shadow play a key role) or during the day (where colour, structure, and layout carry more weight). Whether it’s a miniature snowy street or a complex business process, I’m always thinking about the story, the people involved, and how to bring a vision to life in a way that’s meaningful, efficient, and engaging. It turns out, Christmas windows and tiny holiday villages weren’t just hobbies — they were training grounds.</p>

    <h2>Designing for Others Starts with Listening</h2>
       <p class=""date"> June 2025</p>
      <p>In both life and work, I’ve found that good design has less to do with tools — and everything to do with empathy. It starts not with solutions, but with listening.</p>
      <h3>A Personal Story: Lemax Displays and Lightbulb Moments</h3>
      <p>Every year, I help set up Lemax villages — those miniature festive towns with glowing street lamps, moving ice skaters, and snowy rooftops. But I don’t just walk in and decide what I think looks good. Before placing a single house or tree, I ask: </p>
      <li>What part of the village brings you the most joy?</li>
      <li>Do you want it to feel calm and symmetrical — or playful and packed with detail?</li>
      <li>What’s one piece you want to make sure everyone notices?</li>
      <p>Sometimes, it’s a piece that evokes a memory. Sometimes, it’s about where the kids will look first. Each answer helps shape how I create the scene — because I’m not building for me. I’m building for them. And honestly? That’s the same mindset I bring to stakeholder engagement.</p>
      <h3>Empathy as a BA Skill</h3>
      <p>In business analysis, it’s easy to rush into mapping processes, documenting requirements, or analysing systems. But lasting impact — the kind that makes people say “this actually helped” — starts way earlier. It starts when you: </p>
      <li>Ask someone what frustrates them the most.</li>
      <li>Listen without jumping in to solutionise.</li>
      <li>Understand what success would feel like for them.</li>
      <li>Take in not just what’s said, but what’s not said.</li>
      <p>Stakeholder engagement is not about ticking a checklist. It’s about building trust, being curious, and co-creating something that works for the real people involved. </p>
      <h3>The Takeaway</h3>
      <p>Whether I’m adjusting snow to reflect someone’s memory of childhood winters, or helping teams navigate tricky change, the question stays the same: “What matters most to you?” Because when we start there, what we build becomes meaningful — and memorable. </p>
