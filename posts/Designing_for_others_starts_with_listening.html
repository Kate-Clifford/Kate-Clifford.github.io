    <h2>Designing for Others Starts with Listening</h2>
       <p class=""date"> June 2025</p>
      <p>In both life and work, I’ve found that good design has less to do with tools — and everything to do with empathy. It starts not with solutions, but with listening.</p>
      <h3>A Personal Story: Lemax Displays and Lightbulb Moments</h3>
      <p>Every year, I help set up Lemax villages — those miniature festive towns with glowing street lamps, moving ice skaters, and snowy rooftops. But I don’t just walk in and decide what I think looks good. Before placing a single house or tree, I ask: </p>
      <li>What part of the village brings you the most joy?</li>
      <li>Do you want it to feel calm and symmetrical — or playful and packed with detail?</li>
      <li>What’s one piece you want to make sure everyone notices?</li>
      <p>Sometimes, it’s a piece that evokes a memory. Sometimes, it’s about where the kids will look first. Each answer helps shape how I create the scene — because I’m not building for me. I’m building for them. And honestly? That’s the same mindset I bring to stakeholder engagement.</p>
      <h3>Empathy as a BA Skill</h3>
      <p>In business analysis, it’s easy to rush into mapping processes, documenting requirements, or analysing systems. But lasting impact — the kind that makes people say “this actually helped” — starts way earlier. It starts when you: </p>
      <li>Ask someone what frustrates them the most.</li>
      <li>Listen without jumping in to solutionise.</li>
      <li>Understand what success would feel like for them.</li>
      <li>Take in not just what’s said, but what’s not said.</li>
      <p>Stakeholder engagement is not about ticking a checklist. It’s about building trust, being curious, and co-creating something that works for the real people involved. </p>
      <h3>The Takeaway</h3>
      <p>Whether I’m adjusting snow to reflect someone’s white Christmas dream, or helping teams navigate tricky change, the question stays the same: “What matters most to you?” Because when we start there, what we build becomes meaningful — and memorable. </p>
