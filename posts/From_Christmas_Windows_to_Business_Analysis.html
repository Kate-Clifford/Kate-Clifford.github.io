    <h2>From Christmas Windows to Business Analysis: A personal journey in solution design and collaboration</h2>
    <p class="date">June 2025</p>
    <p>When I was growing up, my family had a large picture window at the front of our house — the perfect canvas for our annual Christmas display. <br> Each year, my siblings and I would take turns choosing the theme for that window. It felt like play, but looking back, it was an early introduction to many of the skills I now use every day as a business analyst. <br> We had to think about storytelling, composition, materials, budget, and timelines. We had to clearly communicate our vision and get buy-in from the rest of the family — much like working with a project team. There were negotiations, trade-offs, creative problem-solving, and always a sense of delivering something that others would enjoy. <br> That spirit has stayed with me. These days, I build Lemax village displays during the holidays. It might sound whimsical, but it's surprisingly similar to BA work. I have constraints: space, time, even the number of power outlets I can use. I work with different "clients" (sometimes setting up displays in other people’s homes), and my goal is always to make the process smooth and enjoyable for them. I tailor the design based on what’s important to them — whether the village will be viewed at night (where light and shadow play a key role) or during the day (where colour, structure, and layout carry more weight). Whether it’s a miniature snowy street or a complex business process, I’m always thinking about the story, the people involved, and how to bring a vision to life in a way that’s meaningful, efficient, and engaging. It turns out, Christmas windows and tiny holiday villages weren’t just hobbies — they were training grounds.</p>
